    <h1 align="center">The Uniques of the Indian Culture</h1>
    <h3 align="center">By: Priya Shah</h3>
    <p>India is the most populous country in the world, hosting about 1.42 billion people. That’s about 17.76% of the world’s population living in India. The majority of India’s population is Indian and follows an Indian culture. For example, they celebrate holidays such as Diwali and Holi, and they eat foods like biryani and pani puri. But Indian culture isn’t as widely known in other countries around the world. Only about 35.4 million Indians are currently living outside of India. The place with the most Indians outside of India is the United States of America, hosting about 4,460,000 million Indians. Following the U.S. is the United Arab Emirates, hosting about 3,425,144 million Indians. That may be a lot, but compared to India’s population, it’s not that much. That’s why a lot of people aren’t very aware of Indian culture. India is the 7th largest country in the world, and it’s about 3,287,263 square kilometers big. Additionally, India is surrounded by three different bodies of water: the Arabian Sea on the left, the Bay of Bengal on the right, and the Indian Ocean on the south. India is bordered by 7 different countries. <img src="C:/Users/pshah/OneDrive/Documents/Personal Project/India-map.avif" align="right" width="300" height="200"> Pakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest, Bangladesh and Myanmar in the east, and Nepal, China, and Bhutan in the north. In India, the weather is generally hot. In the winter, India is cool and dry, with temperatures ranging from about 50 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on where in India you are looking. This winter season lasts from December to February. The summer season lasts from March to May. In these months, it’s generally very hot, with temperatures ranging from 80 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The hottest month of the year is May, with temperatures ranging from 90 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. After that, the monsoon season begins and ranges from June to August. In this season, there is heavy rain and cool temperatures. However, temperatures can rise, and it can get humid, depending on the location. Finally, from September to November, there is the post-monsoon period. In this time, the temperature rises and the rain slows down and occurs less frequently. This season is regarded as the “transition period” from the monsoon season to the drier and warmer seasons. The weather in India affects its people. The heat, at times, forces people to stay inside. The heavy rains can cause houses to fall and crops to be washed away. But there are positives to the monsoon season. After the scorching heat of the summer, the monsoon season can bring cooler temperatures to the country. Additionally, the rains, if not too heavy, can help crops grow, allowing for increased crop production. All of these factors make India unique in its own way. But all of these are talking about the external factors of India, such as the population, geography, and weather. There is so much more inside India that makes India what it is today. India has its own culture that is unique from the rest of the world. That’s what this website is about. This website will give brief summaries on the different aspects of Indian culture, such as the traditions that take place, the foods they eat, the languages that are spoken, and the norms, or the daily activities, of Indians. There are many aspects of culture and many different things that make a culture unique, but this website will only cover summaries of these four aspects of Indian culture to hopefully give you a better idea of Indian culture.</p>
    <h3>Tradition:</h3>
    <p>There are many festivals that are celebrated in India for various reasons. The biggest festival in India is Diwali, which is also called Deepawali in areas of India. Diwali is known as the festival of lights and celebrates the victory of light over darkness. <img src="C:\Users\pshah\OneDrive\Documents\Personal Project/Diwali Picture.webp" align="right" width="200" height="130"> Project It can also celebrate the victory of good over evil or knowledge over ignorance, depending on the way you celebrate it. During this festival, families will clean their homes and light diyas (which are lamps filled with oil) and put them around the house to bring light and prosperity to their homes. These lamps are also lit to help the goddess Lakshmi find her way into their homes and bless the homeowners with wealth and success, since she is the goddess of wealth in Hinduism. Additionally, on the floors, there will be rangolis. Rangolis are designs made with colored rice, flower petals, and other natural materials. These rangolis are placed on the floors of houses and are there to ward off evils that may attempt to enter the house. Diwali is usually celebrated sometime between October and November. The time it is celebrated depends on the moon cycle and varies each year. Another festival that is celebrated in India is Holi. Holi is the festival of colors and is usually celebrated in March. It marks the arrival of spring and the end of winter. It celebrates spring, love, and new life/beginnings. On this day, people unite together, leaving hatred behind, and throw colored powder or water on each other. This creates unity in the community and celebrates everyone. But there is a lot more to Indian tradition than festivals. <img src="C:\Users\pshah\OneDrive\Documents\Personal Project/Kathak Picture.webp" align="left" width="110" height="140"> Indians generally greet each other traditionally using the Namaste greeting, which can also be called the Namaskar greeting. This translates to “I bow to the divine in you” and is seen as a respectful way to say either hello, goodbye, or thank you. This greeting is done by pressing your palms together with your fingers touching each other and pointing upwards. Put your hands about chest height and make a slight bow while greeting the other person. Another tradition in India is that before you enter any temple, you should shower to cleanse and purify yourself before you enter the presence of the gods. Additionally, shoes aren’t worn in temples, so they must be removed before entering a temple. These traditions have stuck with Indians for hundreds of years and should be maintained in respect to the temples and the gods. It’s common to have multiple generations of a family live in the same household in India. The oldest male is considered the head of the house. This tradition has stuck for hundreds of years, though less and less people are doing it. There are many traditional dances that are unique to India. Each type of dance originated from a different area of India and has its own unique style. Some are more graceful, some more fast-paced. They have all been around for hundreds of years and have their own unique histories. In summary, the Indian traditions have shaped Indian culture and made it what it is today.</p>
    <h3>Foods:</h3>
    <p>In India, there are many different types of foods eaten by people all around the country. Indian food is very unique and it’s special to just India. A lot of them differ from each other. North Indian food is different from South Indian food and even the individual states have foods that are popular in only that state. Additionally, many people have dietary restrictions in India. Approximately 39.5% of India’s population are vegetarians. These factors really diversify India’s food. There are a lot of spices used in Indian food that truly makes it unique. Chili powder is used frequently to make foods spicier. Mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds are also widely used in Indian foods to add spice and flavor. Some other powders used are turmeric and garam masala. Turmeric has an orange-yellow color and is used to give curry powder its color and adds a flavor to foods. Garam masala is another popular powder that adds a unique flavor to Indian foods. All of these spices, along with more, are what make Indian food truly unique from the rest of the world’s food. <img src="C:/Users/pshah/OneDrive/Documents/Personal Project/Ghee.jpg" align="right" width="100" height="130"> Another important ingredient that originated in India is Ghee. Ghee is similar to butter and is even made from butter. You make it by putting unsalted butter in a pot and cooking it in a medium-low heat until the middle layer becomes golden and clear. Foam will appear on the top layer and the milk solids will solidify in the bottom layer. Once the middle layer is good, you strain the ghee, getting rid of the foam and the milk solids, leaving just the golden, clear ghee. The ghee can remain at room temperature for a long time, so there’s no need to worry about expiry dates. Ghee is a staple in Indian food. You can use it for many things such as frying vegetables or meats, on top of rotis, melted over steamed veggies to add flavor, a source of good fats for certain recipes, and as a substitute for butter for lactose intolerant people since ghee has no lactose in it. If you don’t want to make it, you can buy it from any Indian store. Additionally, all of the spices mentioned above can be bought at your local Indian grocery store.</p>
    <h4>North vs. South Indian Food:</h4>
    <p>Even though they are a part of the same country, the north and south’s food differs from each other in multiple ways. The north has more wheat heavy foods and the south is more rice based. The south’s food is generally more spicy and tropical compared to the north, which have different, rich spices and thicker sauces. For example, Paneer Butter Masala is very popular in the north and Masala Dosa is popular in the south. The north has a higher abundance of meats and dairy products in their foods while the south uses more vegetables and seafood. The most frequently used meats in the north are mutton and lamb, goat, and chicken. Other meats are eaten, but not as frequently as these. Beef, however, isn’t too popular in India. This is because a large portion of the Indian population is Hindu and Hindus consider cows as sacred so they don’t eat them. Coconut milk is widely used in the south to make curries. Instead of coconut milk, the food in the north uses dairy cream and blended nuts. These different factors are what makes north and south Indian food different from each other.</p>
    <h3>Languages:</h3>
    <p>There are many languages spoken in India. The most popular language in India is Hindi, spoken by about 528 million people. It’s the 3rd most spoken language in the world. <img src="C:/Users/pshah/OneDrive/Documents/Personal Project/Languages.jpg" align="left" width="180" height="100"> There are 22 languages that are officially recognized in India, not including English, which is still really important and is widely used in India. These 22 languages are Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri, Kannada, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, and Urdu. Most of these languages are considered dialects of Hindi. Out of these, Sanskrit is the only language that isn’t a modern language. It is the 2nd oldest language in the world and is commonly used in ancient religious texts for numeral religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism. Sanskrit has had a major impact on other languages, even outside of India. Thailand, Sri Lanka, and China have all inherited and slightly modified certain words from the Sanskrit language and used them on their own. Even Hindi itself originated from Sanskrit. The two official languages of India are Hindi and English. About 129 million people speak English in India, making it the 2nd most spoken language in India and about 9% of the world’s English-speaking population. A lot of Indians speak English as a second language, causing a lot of English speakers in India to be less proficient than native speakers are. According to the 2011 national census, about 10.2% of Indians can speak English. However, only 0.02% of Indians speak English as their first language. More Indians speak it as their third language than their first (about 3.6%), and the majority of English speakers in India consider English as their second language (about 6.57% of speakers). The upper class is more likely to know English than the lower class. This makes sense because English is used in the educational system and the lower class may not have the same access to the same educational system as the upper class does. To sum it up, there are a lot of languages spoken throughout India, both native to India and not.</p>
    <h3>Norms:</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of things that are normal to do in India, but may not be in other parts of the world. <img src="C:/Users/pshah/OneDrive/Documents/Personal Project/hand.png" align="right" width="130" height="140"> For example, most Indians take off their shoes before entering into a household, regardless of if it’s their house or not. Additionally, many Indians eat with their hands, specifically the right hand. This means that you should wash your hands before you eat. In Indian culture, the left hand is considered unclean since that’s the hand people generally use to clean themselves. Therefore, you shouldn’t touch food or eat with your left hand. Some Indians also avoid using the left hand to pass objects since it’s considered unclean. In India, elders are considered very important and should be treated with the utmost respect. Therefore, sometimes when you meet with an elder, you should bow down and touch their feet as a sign of respect. This shows respect for elders, which is common in Indian culture. In India, there are a lot of locally owned shops rather than major supermarkets. In these shops, it’s common to bargain for an item rather than paying its initial price. You can negotiate for almost anything in India and you might even end up paying less than what they are selling it for. Also, there is a lot of street food in India depending on where you go. They sell many popular and tasty Indian snacks such as Pani Puri, Vada Pao, and Chaat. If you ever go eat food from the street, you need to watch out for the sanitary conditions. A lot of times, the people that make the street food don’t completely pay attention to hygiene and sanitation. Therefore, a lot of people get sick from street food. Despite the risk, Indian street food is amazing and you should try it at least once in your life.</p>
    <p>To sum it up, Indian culture is truly unique from the rest of the world. There are so many different aspects of it that makes it what it is. From the traditions, to the foods, to the many languages spoken, to the normalities, Indian culture is amazing and should be recognized throughout the world. I hope this website taught you a bit about Indian culture and its beauty. If you ever decide to visit India in the future, I hope you enjoy the many things it has to offer.</p>
